# qgis2fds
Export terrain elevation, landuse, and georeferencing to NIST FDS for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wild fire simulation

Your plugin QGIS2FDS was created in:
    /home/egissi/github/firetools/qgis2fds

Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
    /home/egissi/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins

What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``QGIS2FDS.py``

  * You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when
    you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
