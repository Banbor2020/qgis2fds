# qgis2fds

Export terrain elevation, landuse, and georeferencing from QGIS to NIST FDS for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) wild fire simulation and atmospheric fire pollutants dispersion

# Welcome to the QGIS2FDS Plugin repository!

The open source plugin to export terrains and landuse from the [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) geographic information system to the [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) for wildfire simulation and atmospheric dispersion of fire pollutants.

To learn how to use this plugin, please read the [wiki](https://github.com/firetools/qgis2fds/wiki).

The development of QGIS2FDS is funded by a grant from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

By the research project WUIFI-21 (High fidelity computational fluid dynamics modeling of forest fires for Wildland-Urban Interface communities resilience and protection) the participating organizations intend to extend the capabilities of FDS on the prediction of wildland-urban interface fires propagation.
