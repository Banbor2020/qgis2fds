# Welcome to the *qgis2fds* plugin repository!

The open source plugin to export terrains and landuse from the [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) geographic information system to the [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/) for wildfire simulation and atmospheric dispersion of fire pollutants.

 * **Learn** how to use qgis2fds on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/firetools/qgis2fds/wiki).
 * **Discuss** about its usage on the [qgis2fds discussion group](https://groups.google.com/g/qgis2fds).
 * File **issues** on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/firetools/qgis2fds/issues).

The development of *qgis2fds* is funded by a grant from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

By the research project WUIFI-21 (High fidelity computational fluid dynamics modeling of forest fires for Wildland-Urban Interface communities resilience and protection) the participating organizations intend to extend the capabilities of FDS on the prediction of wildland-urban interface fires propagation.
